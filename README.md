# awesome-embedded default community files
✨special repository housing default community health files and organization readme ✨

As per the [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) documentation this repository contains default community health files for all repositories under the awesome-embedded organization. When a repository does not provide included community health files the defaults will be used instead.
