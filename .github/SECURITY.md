this project is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one, please report it privately.

Vulnerabilities should be reported using [GitHub's mechanism for privately reporting a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Under the
[main repository's security tab](../../../security), click "Report a vulnerability" to open the advisory form.

A member of the project team will triage the reported vulnerability and if the vulnerability is accepted a security advisory will be published and all further communication will be done via that security advisory.

🙏 Thank you for helping us keep our projects secure! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.
